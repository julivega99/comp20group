            <h3> Who are we? </h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of Blue Hat is simple: it allows students to make the best out of their 4 short years in college while still excelling academically. Blue Hat offers students personalized assignments for their classes while remaining anonymous. Blue Hat does not require names, just payment, and provides results. The magic of Blue Hat is that it is invisible and cannot be held accountable to academic integrity. Every assignment is made by a student for a student, and there are various plans to fit each studentâ€™s need. Every student pays a monthly subscription, why not add Blue Hat? And the only rule of Blue Hat is that you do not talk about Blue Hat.
