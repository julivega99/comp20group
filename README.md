# BLUEHAT

NOTES:

10/26
Currently, the content portion of the pages (<section></section>) has z-index=-1, as that is what allows the navigation bar to overlap them. If you are working with forms, create a new div around the section header. 

If I figure out how to implement transparency for the header so that it isnt one big layer over the page, I'll do that and push an update. For now, just try to keep the forms on a seperate div, and keep the forms from crossing the navigation bar, as it will break the illusion of proper formatting
